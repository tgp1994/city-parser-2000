City Parser 2000
================

## Overview
City Parser 2000 is a simple C# library which interprets and represents data from binary Sim City 2000&copy; files (.SC2 file format) as C# objects. This project is licensed under the GNU GPL v3 license. See LICENSE.md for more information.

## Current Status
This project is going through an overhaul at the moment, to create a more modular and efficient codebase.

**Update June 15:** Development is currently on hold while I work on creating a renderer to visualize most of the features being developed.

## Future Development
- Further the already extensive amount of research into the SC2 format, especially where the MISC segment is concerned.
- Interpret more of the SC2 file.
- Accept generic data inputs instead of just a local file.

##Credits
- [David Moews](http://djm.cc/simcity-2000-info.txt), without his extensive research, this project would not have been possible.
- [Dustin Fennell](https://github.com/dwfennell/city-parser-2000), for his work on initially creating this project and getting most of the framework done.
- [nattress](https://github.com/nattress/simcity-minecraft), for their work on the Simcity-Minecraft project from which a lot of code and design has been referenced.
- The great community of [XeNTaX](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php?title=Simcity_2000_Special_Edition), for providing a wiki to gather my research on the SC2 file.
